          text: `A computer is an electronic machine that receives data, processes it according to instructions, stores information, and produces results. The basic process can be described as input, processing, output, and storage. When you type something on a keyboard, the computer receives input. The processor works with that information, and the system produces an output such as text on a screen. Computers can perform millions or billions of operations very quickly, but they still depend on instructions created by humans.`,

          text: `Database tables often use keys to identify records and connect related information. A primary key uniquely identifies a record within a table. A foreign key stores a reference to a record in another table. Relationships allow databases to represent connected information without storing the same data repeatedly. For example, an order can contain a customer identifier that connects the order to a particular customer record.`,
